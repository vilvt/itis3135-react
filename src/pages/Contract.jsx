      <h2>Contract</h2>

      <p>
        I, SAIGE C. HATFIELD agree to abide by the terms of the course contract
        in my Fall 2025, ITIS 3135, Front-End Development with my instructor,
        Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on
        publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will
        not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that
        I wish to keep private.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
        logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments
        may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and
        content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even
        view my classmates’ code directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut
        and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external
        libraries) and never from my classmates.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Signed:</strong> Saige C. Hatfield, 08/31/2025
